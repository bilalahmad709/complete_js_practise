    <h2>Function in JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
        a function in JavaScript is like a recipe. It's a set of instructions that you can give a name to.
         You can create a function to perform a specific task or series of tasks, and then you can use that
          function by calling its name whenever you need those instructions to be executed. It helps in 
          organizing code and making it reusable. Just like a recipe helps you bake a cake, a function helps 
          your code perform a certain action when needed.

        // is k bhech may ham aor kaam bhe kar sakty hn.
        document.write("ye waqfa lenay k leay may nay dosra sentence print kr deyaa <br><br>");
