    <!-- definition and explanation of array -->

    <h2>What is Array :</h2>
    <p>
        an array in JavaScript is a data structure that allows you to store a collection of elements.
         It's a variable that can hold more than one value at a time. Arrays can contain various types of 
         data such as numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays.

They are defined using square brackets [] and elements within the array are separated by commas.
 Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, 
 and so on.
 Arrays in JavaScript offer various methods and properties to manipulate and access their elements, 
 like push, pop, slice, splice, forEach, and many more, making them versatile for handling collections of data.

For example:
<br><br>
<!-- code for the syntax of array -->
<code>
    let fruits = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana']; <br>
console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: 'apple' <br> <br>
console.log(fruits.length); // Output: 3

</code>
    </p>
