    <h2> WHAT IS BREAK AND CONTINUE STATEMENT IN JavaScript</h2>

    <!-- difference between break and continue statement -->
    
    <P>
        In JavaScript, break and continue are control flow statements 
        used within loops (like for, while, do-while) to alter the flow of execution.
        
        <h3>Break statement :</h3>
        break: When encountered inside a loop, break immediately exits the loop it's currently in,
         regardless of the loop condition. It completely terminates the loop's execution and moves on to the
          next statement after the loop.

          <!-- code for break statement -->
          <code>
            for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) 
            {
                if (i === 3) {
                  break; // exits the loop when i equals 3
                }
                console.log(i);
              }
              // Output: 0, 1, 2
              
          </code>
         
          <h3>continue statement :</h3>
          continue: When continue is encountered, it stops the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration,
           skipping any code that comes after it within the loop for that particular iteration.

           <!-- code for continue statement -->
           <code>
            for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                if (i === 2) {
                  continue; // skips the rest of the loop body for i equals 2
                }
                console.log(i);
              }
              // Output: 0, 1, 3, 4
              
           </code>
    </P>
